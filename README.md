## üöÄ Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Self-hosting or running Rocksky locally is still **difficult** at this stage.
> Parts of the API are still tied to [**Xata Postgres**](https://xata.io), and a full migration to standard **Postgres** is ongoing.
> Until this migration is complete, expect setup to be non-trivial.
