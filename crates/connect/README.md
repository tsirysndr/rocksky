# Rocksky Connect 🔌

Remote playback control for any local player — inspired by "Spotify Connect".

Rocksky Connect lets you link your local music player to the Rocksky Web UI, enabling seamless remote playback control from anywhere. It's like Spotify Connect, but designed to work with any player that integrates with Rocksky.

🛠️ **Work in progress:** Rocksky Connect is still under active development — features and compatibility may change frequently.
