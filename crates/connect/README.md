# Rocksky Connect 🔌

Remote playback control for any local player — inspired by "Spotify Connect".

Rocksky Connect lets you link your local music player to the Rocksky Web UI https://rocksky.app, enabling seamless remote playback control from anywhere. It's like Spotify Connect, but designed to work with any player that integrates with Rocksky.

🐲 **Work in progress:** Rocksky Connect is still under active development — features and compatibility may change frequently.

**Note:** Only [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) is currently working with Rocksky Connect. Other players will be supported in the future.
